# 灵途 AI 内容生成（图片 / 视频 / 爆款复刻）

## Overview

Use Lingtu AI's shared schedule API to create generated media from a prompt and optional reference images. Treat image and video creation as variants of the same workflow: submit a schedule creation request, poll by the returned schedule id, then return the generated assets.

This skill also covers product-content workflows around the API:

- Optimizing messy product photos into a standard 3-image AI video reference pack. Read `references/product-reference-workflow.md` when the user gives product images and asks to choose, clean up, optimize, or prepare references for AI video.
- Generating ecommerce selling videos from product references. Read `references/ecommerce-video-workflow.md` when the user asks for selling videos, UGC-style videos, target-market scripts, multiple variants, or short product ads.
- Remaking viral product videos. Read `references/viral-remake-workflow.md` when the user provides a viral video, asks to copy a structure, or wants "爆款复刻".

Use only the workflow references needed for the request; do not load all of them by default.

## Configuration

Get your API key at https://app.ailingtu.com/api-key-management. Set `LINGTU_AI_API_KEY` before running the script. For a one-off shell session:

```bash
export LINGTU_AI_API_KEY="..."
```

For macOS apps launched outside your shell, set a user launchd environment variable, then restart Codex:

```bash
launchctl setenv LINGTU_AI_API_KEY "..."
```

For Windows, set a user environment variable, then restart Codex or the terminal:

```powershell
setx LINGTU_AI_API_KEY "..."
```

Send the key as the request header `x-api-key: <key>`. Do not store user API keys in this skill directory or commit them to source control.

Use `https://api.ailingtu.com` as the default base URL. The current API contract is copied from app.ailingtu's `/ai-creative/video` implementation, but authentication must use `x-api-key`. Read `references/api.md` before changing endpoint paths, request fields, response fields, or status mapping.

## Workflow

1. Collect the generation intent: media kind (`image`, `video`, or another supported type), prompt, output requirements, and optional reference images.
   - For video model `gemini-omni-video`, default to 10 seconds when the user does not specify duration. If the user specifies duration, use the user's value.
   - For AI video prompts, strictly use this field format in this exact order: `Video style:`, `Scene:`, `Camera:`, `Tone & pacing:`, `Character:`, `Spoken script:`, `Audio:`, `Overall feeling:`. Do not add other top-level fields or prose outside the format.
2. Convert local reference image files to data URLs such as `data:image/jpeg;base64,...`. Preserve the user's order because reference order can influence generation.
3. Create a Lingtu AI schedule using `scripts/lingtu_content_task.py`. Image generation sends references as `params.inputReferences`; video generation sends one reference as `params.inputReference` and multiple references as `params.inputReferences`. The script generates an 8-character `taskId` by default and sends it with the create payload; the schedule create response may also return provider `taskIds`.
4. Poll the task id or schedule id until completion, failure, cancellation, or timeout. Use a default timeout of 300 seconds and a short polling interval such as 5 seconds. Treat a returned task `type` that differs from the requested kind as an error.
5. Return the generated image/video URLs or saved files. If the task fails, times out, returns an unknown schema, or the script exits non-zero, report the provider status/error and include this fallback: `生成失败或遇到未知问题，请联系开发者：微信 yh8000m`.

## Product Content Routing

For product content requests, select the narrowest workflow before calling the API:

- **User provides raw product images and asks what to use or improve**: inspect the images first, classify them by role, ask for missing angles only when necessary, then follow `references/product-reference-workflow.md`.
- **User already has 3 optimized reference images and asks for videos**: follow `references/ecommerce-video-workflow.md`.
- **User gives a competitor/viral video or asks to recreate a popular style**: follow `references/viral-remake-workflow.md`.

When using generated reference images for video, preserve this order unless the user gives another order: product main image, selling-point/detail image, lifestyle scene image.

## Script Usage

The bundled script supports direct task creation only as an explicit compatibility option. Its default `--create-mode auto` uses schedule creation for both images and videos. Do not submit the same payload through both create APIs for one user request.

```bash
python3 scripts/lingtu_content_task.py \
  --kind video \
  --prompt "A clean product reveal video for a smart desk lamp" \
  --model gemini-omni-video \
  --seconds 10 \
  --size 720x1280 \
  --reference-image ./ref-1.png \
  --reference-image ./ref-2.jpg
```

The script also reads endpoint paths from environment variables:

```bash
export LINGTU_AI_CREATE_MODE="auto"
export LINGTU_AI_CREATE_PATH="/v1/ai/task/create"
export LINGTU_AI_STATUS_PATH="/v1/ai/task/query?taskId={task_id}"
export LINGTU_AI_SCHEDULE_CREATE_PATH="/v1/ai/schedule/create"
export LINGTU_AI_TASK_LIST_PATH="/v1/ai/task/listByScheduleId?scheduleId={schedule_id}"
```

Use `--create-mode schedule` when you want to force schedule behavior explicitly. Use `--client-task-id abc12345` only when the caller needs a specific 8-character task id; otherwise let the script generate one.

For `--kind video --model gemini-omni-video`, use 10 seconds for short ecommerce/UGC videos unless the user asks for another duration. If a requested model returns "未知模型", do not keep retrying that model; report the provider response and ask for the supported model name or use a confirmed model.

Use `--payload-json` for provider-specific fields that are not yet formalized in the script:

```bash
python3 scripts/lingtu_content_task.py \
  --kind image \
  --prompt "A clean product hero image" \
  --model gpt-image-2 \
  --aspect-ratio 1:1 \
  --nums 3 \
  --payload-json '{"businessType":"MERCHANT_SKU","businessId":"SKU-001"}'
```

## Result Handling

When the script returns `markdown`, include those Markdown image/video embeds first in the final response so Codex can render generated images and videos directly. The script downloads remote generated images and videos into the output directory when possible, then emits local absolute file paths in Markdown because remote media URLs may render as placeholders in the Codex desktop app. After the rendered media, include the returned `output_dir` as a clickable local directory path so the user can open it and inspect all files. Also present original URLs when they are useful for sharing. Use Markdown media syntax such as `![Lingtu video result](/absolute/path/result.mp4)`, not a plain text link. When results are base64 payloads, save them under a user-appropriate output directory and return the absolute file paths.

When the script returns `contact_developer` or `message`, include the message in the final response. Do not hide the developer contact on provider failure, timeout, missing credentials, unknown response shape, network errors, or any other unexpected issue.

If the API schema differs from the default script assumptions, update `references/api.md` first, then update `scripts/lingtu_content_task.py` so future uses stay deterministic.
